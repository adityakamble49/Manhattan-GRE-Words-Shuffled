Related Words: Infamous is a synonym for notorious.

More Info: Not only did rapper The Notorious B.I.G. adopt the word notorious for his name, actress
Tori Spelling has starred in a reality show entitled “So NoTORIous.” We guess it’s cool to be famous
in a bad way?

“bad”), which as an adjective means “evil, harmful, or malicious” (as a verb, it can also mean
“slander or defame”). The variant benignant is used the same way as benign.

Definition: Sameness or repetitiousness to the point of being boring; lack of variation, uniformity,

Usage: The monotony of working on a factory assembly line made her feel as though she would go
insane from boredom.

Related Words: Tedium (that which is tiresome due to being too long, dull, or slow, as in The plot
moved at a tedious pace).

More Info: Monotone comes from Latin parts for “one tone,” like a dial tone on an old-fashioned
phone, or a very boring public speaker. Now, we can use monotony for things other than sound—for
instance, studying vocabulary can get a little monotonous if you don’t make an effort to keep it
interesting by writing your own fun sentences, practicing with friends, and thinking about the
gloriousness of a high GRE score.

Related Words: Enervate (weaken, tire), Enfeeble (weaken, make feeble)

More Info: The meaning of sap as a gullible or simple person is thought to be related to calling
someone a “sapskull”—the idea being that the person’s head is made of soft, sappy wood from the
inside of a tree.

specious), Uncouth (having bad manners, awkward)

More Info: Sadly, nearly all cultures are biased against left-handed people. Gauche is simply the
French word for left (similarly, the word sinister comes from the Latin word for left). The French

is excessive indulgence in sensual pleasures.

More Info: Libertine certainly is related to “liberty”—think of a libertine as someone who has a
little too much liberty. You can also use libertine as an adjective (as in libertine attitudes).

a cat and a dog, respectively makes it clear that the cat is Lisa’s and the dog is John’s.

(such as medicine, law, etc.)

for him). Don’t confuse prodigal with prodigy (very gifted child).

More Info: Many people automatically think of discriminating as bad, because they are thinking of
racial discrimination. However, discriminating is simply telling things apart and can be an important
skill—it is important to discriminate legitimate colleges from fraudulent diploma mills, for instance.

confusing root, though, as “bell” can also mean “war,” as in belligerent, bellicose, rebellion. In
Latin, “bellus” meant “dress up” and “bellum” meant war).

inactivity, esp. caused by equal but opposing forces), Standing (existing indefinitely, not movable, as

we grow more rice than China! Absurd.

Related Words: Bigot (obstinately prejudiced person), Xenophobia (fear of foreigners), Jingoism
(extreme chauvinism plus warlike foreign policy)

moved at a tedious pace)

More Info: To ponder is simply to contemplate or think deeply about. But ponderous means boring,
difficult to make your way through. Both are based on the idea of “heaviness”—considering “heavy”

                                              COH-gent

Definition: Very convincing, logical

Usage: Studying logic is an excellent way to improve at formulating cogent arguments. / Nurses who
work in the Alzheimer’s ward must develop skills for communicating with people who are often not
cogent.

More Info: Cogent comes from two roots meaning “together” and “drive”—a cogent argument
allows you to “drive” your listener to your conclusion. The resemblance of cogent to cognition,
cognitive, cogitation, and excogitate—words about thinking—is merely a coincidence, but a helpful
one.

A carbon offset is a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases that can be applied to compensate
for emissions made someplace else. That is, a company that sends out a lot of carbon dioxide can
compensate for polluting by financially supporting energy efficiency or wind turbine projects.

Definition: Simple and unsophisticated, unsuspecting, lacking worldly experience and critical
judgment

Usage: I was a little naïve during the hiring process—the HR rep asked for my acceptable salary
range, and I answered honestly. Of course I got an offer for the very lowest number in the range! Now
I know I should have tried to get a number from her first, or named a higher number so I could
negotiate down.

Related Words: Dupe (person who is easily fooled or used, or to fool or exploit), Sap (person easily
taken advantage of), Credulous (gullible)

More Info: Naïvete (or naïveté) looks strange because it’s French; it just means naïveness. Other
strange spellings also pop up in regards to this word: naïf, naïfness, naïfly—all the same word. As a
noun, a naïf or naïve is simply a naïve person.

as a substitute), Faux (fake, imitation, as in “faux fur”), Specious (pleasing to the eye but deceptive)

Usage: Virginia Woolf’s feminism is hard to truly understand unless contextualized within the mores

performing various actions with the device, but in the end, your “pet” still looks very much like a
keychain.

Related Words: Nominal can mean “in name only” but not in fact. In this way, it is something of an
opposite to virtual, which can mean not in name, but existing in reality (The abused maid was
nominally a free person, but kept as a virtual slave). De facto means “in fact, actually” (but not in
name, as in “Some allege that Edith Wilson was the de facto—or virtual—President after her

Usage: You cannot be forced to testify against your spouse in a court of law—it’s pretty impossible

More Info: The “e” in enervate is a variant of the prefix “ex” and means “out,” while “nerv” means

Definition: Wise in practical matters, carefully providing for the future

Usage: Katie’s friends blew all kinds of money on spring break, but Katie prudently kept to her usual
spending habits: she’d drink one of whatever was least expensive, and then watch her friends get

full-time job and a 401K.

Definition: Metaphorical, based on figures of speech; containing many figures of speech (as fancy-
sounding writing); related to portraying human or animal figures

Usage: The painter was renowned for his figurative art, including many portraits—he had been
known to say that abstract artists were just people who had never learned to draw. / Highly
figurative language can be difficult for English language learners—for instance, to “throw the baby
out with the bath water” refers to being too hasty and unwisely getting rid of the good with the bad.

Related Words: The opposite of figurative is literal, although in regular speech, people often use
literal to mean figurative. People who say I was literally ready to kill someone rarely mean that,
which is why we are not alarmed when they say that. We understand that they are really speaking

Definition: Condescending, having a superior manner, treating as an inferior

Usage: I’m not surprised that Professor McDougal used to teach kindergarten. His patronizing tone
has been driving me crazy. Not only does he assume we can barely add or subtract, he also makes us
put our heads down and have a moment of silence.

More Info: As a verb, patronize means to be a patron of—that is, to support with money. You can be
a patron of the arts, and restaurants sometimes have signs thanking you for your patronage. This
meaning is positive, while being patronizing is negative. What’s the connection? This word (along
with patriotic) comes from the Latin “pater,” for “father.” Even in Roman times, fathers had a certain
stereotype—they give you money, but they also talk to you like you’re a little kid.

story, but somehow now he’s ranting about how nobody celebrates Arbor Day anymore. That
digression could take awhile.

Definition: Government characterized by many bureaus and petty administrators or by excessive,
seemingly meaningless requirements

Usage: Some nations have a worse reputation for bureaucracy than others—in order to get a visa, he
had to file papers with four different agencies, wait for hours in three different waiting rooms, and,
weeks later, follow up with some petty bureaucrat who complained that the original application
should’ve been filed in triplicate.

More Info: There is nothing wrong with bureaus (the Federal Bureau of Investigation, for instance),
but bureaucracy takes the idea much too far. While, technically, bureaucracy can simply mean a
form of government by bureaus, it is virtually always used in the negative sense of excessive “red
tape.”

Definition: Coming from, based on, or able to be verified by experience or experimentation; not purely based on theory

Usage: The Ancient Greeks philosophized about the nature of matter (concluding, for instance, that everything was made of earth, water,
air, and fire) without any empirical evidence—that is, the very idea of conducting experiments hadn’t been invented yet. / People
always knew empirically that when something is dropped, it falls to the ground; the theory of gravity later explained why.

More Info: In Ancient Greece, practitioners of medicine who relied on experience rather than theory were of the Empiric School; in
contrast, the Dogmatic school followed the teachings of Hippocrates above all. In philosophy, a priori knowledge is that which can be
deduced from logic alone, and a posteriori knowledge is empirical.

Definition: Plunge, fall straight down

Usage: During the first 60 seconds or so of a skydive, the diver plummets towards Earth in freefall; 
then, he or she activates a parachute and floats down at what seems like a relatively leisurely pace.

More Info: As a noun, a plummet (or plumb bob) is a weight on the end of a cord. To plumb (or 
sound) the depths of a body of water is to drop a plummet (or sounding line) and see how much cord 
is used when the plummet hits the bottom, and therefore how deep the water is. When something 
plummets, the idea is that it is falling fast and straight down, as though it has been weighted.

unpleasant prologue to the evening, the food poisoning we came down with that night was an even

famous or talented person (noun); to obscure, darken, make less important (verb)

Usage: During a solar eclipse, the moon eclipses the Sun. / Billy Ray Cyrus, who had a hit song,
“Achy Breaky Heart,” in the ‘90s, has long since found his fame eclipsed by that of his daughter,
Miley.

Related Words: Occult can mean “supernatural, mysterious, arcane,” but as a verb, can also mean “to

Usage: Because he felt self-conscious about his stutter, Mike had always been taciturn, but after
some very good speech therapy, soon he was much more voluble.

More Info: Taciturn is related to tacit (understood without being said; implied, not stated directly;
silent).

Usage: When her terror subsided, she realized that the house wasn’t really haunted. / It is a chronic
illness—symptoms will flare up and subside over one’s lifetime.

Related Words: Abate (reduce, diminish)

More Info: From the Latin for “sink to the bottom,” subside is related to sediment (material at the
bottom of a liquid) and sedentary (not moving around, as a person with an inactive lifestyle).

More Info: Of course, everyone knows qualified in the sense of qualified for the job. Use context to
determine which meaning is intended. A qualified person is suitable or well-prepared for the job; a
qualified statement or feeling is held back or limited.

Definition: Waver in one’s mind or opinions, be indecisive

Usage: In need of a good used car, I was vacillating between the Ford and the Hyundai until a
recommendation from a friend helped me decide.

Related Words: Equivocate (use unclear language to deceive or avoid committing to a position),
Ambivalent (uncertain; unable to decide, or wanting to do two contradictory things at once), Waffle
(waver, be indecisive), Dither (act irresolutely), Tergiversate (repeatedly change one’s opinions,
equivocate)
Memory Trick: Vacillate sounds a bit like Vaseline. When you vacillate, your decisions are quite
slippery, as though coated in petroleum jelly.

Definition: Status, rank, reputation (noun); existing indefinitely, not movable (adj)

Usage: As he had feared, his divorce greatly reduced his standing as a relationship expert. / I’m
disappointed that you don’t want to leave your current job, but I want you to know that you have a
standing invitation—as long as I’m the boss, you have a job here anytime you want one. / While the
U.S. has a standing army (that is, an army that is not disbanded in times of peace), Costa Rica’s
constitution actually forbids a standing military.

More Info: “Longstanding” and the expressions “of long standing” or “in good standing” are based on
standing, as in a longstanding friendship or an account in good standing (generally an account for
which all debts are paid).

the author’s life doesn’t happen to be relevant to your thesis. / Maize, which originated in the New
World, is extraneous to Europe.

Related Words: Superfluous (extra, unnecessary, excessive)

More Info: In Latin, “extra” means “outside of.” The “coming from without” meaning of extraneous
can also be expressed with extrinsic, the antonym of which is intrinsic.

a peripheral concern.

Definition: Lightness (of mind, spirit, or mood) or lack of seriousness, sometimes in an inappropriate
way

Usage: My late uncle Bill loved practical jokes and absolutely would have approved of the iPod mix
my aunt played at the wake, which added a little levity by segueing from “Amazing Grace” to the
party anthem “Let’s Get It Started.”

leaven (to cause bread to rise) and levitate (to cause to float, such as in a magic show).

concrete is stronger than cement alone.

Related Words: Agglomerate (collect into a mass), Consolidate (unite, combine, firm up—you can 
consolidate loans or consolidate power)

More Info: Aggregate can be used in the same sense as a gross amount. Gross or aggregate sales 
are the total amount from all sources.

Definition: Clear, easy to understand; rational, sane

Usage: After surgery, it’ll take at least an hour until she’s lucid—it’s nothing to worry about, but
patients sometimes talk complete nonsense until the anesthesia wears off and their speech becomes
lucid.

Related Words: Lucid can mean literally clear, but often means metaphorically clear or clearheaded
—a lucid argument, a lucid person. The similar pellucid usually means literally transparent, as in
pellucid waters.

More Info: The root “luc” for “light” also occurs in translucent, luminous, luminary, lucubrate
(work or study, originally by candlelight), and elucidate (make clear, explain).

Definition: Remaining after expenses or other factors have been deducted; ultimate (adj); to bring in
as profit, or to catch as in a net (verb)

Usage: In one day of trading, my portfolio went up $10,000 and down $8,000, for a net gain of
$2,000. / All those weeks of working weekends and playing golf with the boss ought to net her a
promotion.

Related Words: The opposite of net is gross. Your gross income is what your company pays you, and
your net income is what you actually get to take home. If you sell merchandise, all the money you
collect is the gross, but very little of that (or even none of it) may be profit—you have to subtract
expenses to calculate the net.

More Info: A related idea is tare. If you go to a pay-by-the-pound salad bar and get your salad in a
heavy dish, the person weighing the salad will often deduct the tare—the weight of the dish—prior to
calculating what you pay.

Definition: Wordy

Usage: Twitter’s 140 character limit really forces the verbose to go against their natural tendencies
and instead write succinctly.

Related Words: Loquacious, Prolix, and Voluble mean “talkative, wordy.”

More Info: The Latin “verbum” means “word” and of course gives us verb, verbal, etc., and also
verbiage (excess words or style of expressing something in words). A verbose person could stand to
cut down on the verbiage.

Usage: The startup struggled for years before it simply imploded—the management team broke into
factions, all the clients were scared off, and employees who hadn’t been paid in weeks began taking
the office computers home with them in retribution.

into—and then out of—a tough situation. The slogan is “Sometimes you need a little finesse,
sometimes you need a lot.”

Definition: Potential, in the future

Usage: Everyone had a hard time correctly saying the name of the seminar, “Perspectives for
Prospective Doctors.” Even the prospective doctors—college students hoping to be admitted to
medical school—were a bit confused.

More Info: Don’t confuse with perspective (point of view). Perspective is a noun, which is a good
clue that you want prospective in phrases like “prospective student” (usually a person applying to a
college but not yet accepted).

Definition: Social outcast, untouchable

Usage: After the schoolteacher was fired for participating in what some called a “hate rally,” he
became a pariah in his own town, glared at in the grocery store—even his longtime barber refused
him a haircut.

system and to the lowest group of people in it, the “untouchables” or pariahs.

difference in her appearance—after four weeks, she had lost three-quarters of a pound.

appreciable amount or difference is large enough to matter, and a negligible amount or difference is 
so small it can safely be ignored.

willfully ignored any evidence that undermined the conclusion they were being paid to produce. /
You are nice to my face, but you are undermining me behind my back, suggesting to others in the
office that I am making mistakes in my work and that you have been fixing them!

More Info: Don’t confuse with undergird (strengthen, add support) and underscore (emphasize).
Undermine literally comes from the idea of “mining” underneath—certainly, mining under your house
would be likely to make the house fall down.

Definition: Ordinary, dull, commonplace

Usage: It was so amazing when you had us over to dinner and made that rack of lamb! I’m afraid
neither of us is a professional chef like you are, though, so we hope you won’t mind that we’ve made
something more pedestrian: hot dogs and French fries.

Related Words: Prosaic means “relating to prose” or “ordinary, dull, commonplace”—the idea being
that prose is not as exciting or noble as poetry.

More Info: Of course, a pedestrian is also someone who travels on foot (the root for “foot” also
appears in pedal, moped, and podiatrist). The connection with “ordinary” is that a distinguished
person would travel on horseback—only the common folk would travel on foot.

Usage: An exponent of clean fuel, he petitioned the state government to commit to replacing

Related Words: Proponent (person who proposes or argues in favor of something)

More Info: Of course, an exponent is also the number to which another number is raised. Both senses
of the word come from the verb expound, meaning “interpret, explain, state in detail.” In a sense, an
exponent on a number expounds upon that number by telling us how many times the number is to be
multiplied by itself.

                                        Also unscathed (adj)

Definition: Severe, injurious; bitterly harsh or critical (as a remark)

Usage: The school superintendant gave a scathing criticism of the education bill, calling it “an attack
on our community’s children that will surely go down in infamy.” / How is it possible that she flew
off her bicycle like that and walked away unscathed?

More Info: As you can see from the use of unscathed to mean “not physically injured,” scathing
originally referred to physical injury and now generally refers to injurious comments. A word used in
a similar metaphorical way is excoriate, which literally means “to rub the skin off of” but is more
often used to mean “to criticize very harshly.”

chronic (ongoing, usually of an illness), and anachronism (thing out of its own time period).

Definition: Rude, ill-mannered, or insensitive person; a peasant or country bumpkin

Usage: Milton was such a boor that, when Jane brought him home to meet her parents, he laughed at
their garden gnome and made fun of everyone’s hairstyles in old family photos. “Don’t be so
boorish!” said his mortified girlfriend.

Related Words: Churl is a synonym and can also be used in its adjective form, churlish. Bumpkin,

Usage: The ardent Star Trek fan emulated Captain Kirk in every way possible—his brash and
confident leadership might have gotten him somewhere, but the women he tried to impress weren’t so
impressed.

word for “copy” that has a somewhat negative connotation is ape (based on the idea of a large
primate trying to copy humans), as in “While he tried to ape Hemingway’s style, the truth is, he
simply wasn’t a very good writer.”

Definition: Prohibit, outlaw; denounce; exile or banish

Usage: Plagiarism is proscribed by every college’s code of conduct.

Related Words: Censure (strong disapproval or official reprimand), Circumscribe (encircle or
confine, set limits)

More Info: The “scribe” in proscribe means “write” (as in script, scribble, scripture, etc.) The sense
is that to proscribe is to publish a record of someone’s punishment—to condemn or sentence that
person publicly. Don’t confuse proscribe with prescribe, which means “order, set down as a rule”
(like a doctor’s prescription)—the two words are opposites!

many cultures and languages.

Related Words: Heterogeneous (different in type, incongruous; composed of different types of
elements) is the antonym of homogeneous.

More Info: The Latin root “gen” means “birth, produce, race” and appears in generate, genus,

come before.” If something is unprecedented, nothing has come before it. In law, a precedent is a
ruling in a similar case that a judge would draw on or reference in writing a decision.

baking soda you buy—just arbitrarily pick one so we can get out of this grocery store before 
dinnertime.

More Info: Arbitrary looks a lot like arbiter for good reason—originally, something arbitrary was

a minor problem early in the movie from which the male lead rescues her, and they get together but
then break up due to a misunderstanding, and then they end up together anyway, all while the female
lead’s “sassy” friend gives advice. Ugh. I’ll bet they’re auditioning Jennifer Aniston right now.

Related Words: Banal, Hackneyed, Inane, Insipid and Trite all mean “lacking freshness and

More Info: Hackney in London was once out in the countryside and was a place from which you could

reckoned the only person in the school who can reckon the number of primes under 500 in less than
one minute.”

metaphorically shut up in a box.

Definition: Very disciplined and stern; frugal, living simply, austere; suggestive of the ancient
Spartans

Usage: A young soldier in the spartan environment of boot camp can really long for a home-cooked
meal or even just a comfortable couch to sit on. / Her apartment was so spartan that she couldn’t
even serve us both soup—she only had one bowl and one spoon. Instead, we sat in hard-backed
chairs and drank water.

Related Words: Ascetic (pertaining to a simple life with no luxuries, such as that of a monk), Austere
(severe in manner or appearance; very self-disciplined)

More Info: The Spartans (ancient Greeks from Sparta) were portrayed in the 2006 movie 300,
starring Gerard Butler. The movie isn’t very historically accurate, but the Spartans certainly were
fierce warriors known for their harsh training methods.

answer! / His timely departure prevented him from having to do any work.

Related Words: Opportune can be a synonym for timely, or can mean “favorable, appropriate.”

in one arm, leading a horse with the other—against an adverse current.

Related Words: Antagonistic (hostile, acting in opposition)

More Info: Adverse appears in “adverse criticism,” although that expression is a bit redundant. 
Adverse is also related to adversary (an opponent, foe).

turned out to be just the evidence needed to exculpate him of robbing a bank fifty miles away.

Related Words: Vindicate and Exonerate are synonyms.

Definition: Just begun, undeveloped, unorganized

Usage: The first few weeks of language class went well, but her inchoate French was all but useless
when she found herself at an academic conference in Quebec.

Related Words: Nascent and Incipient mean “just beginning to exist, or in a very early stage of
development.” Inchoate has more of a sense of vagueness. An inchoate idea for a novel probably
means you don’t know where to start writing; a nascent project, although just beginning, might be
right on track.

More Info: Inchoate comes from the Latin “cohum,” a strap attached to an ox’s yoke; the sense here is
“to begin work.”

Definition: Appreciate fully, taste or smell with pleasure

Usage: As a parent, it’s important to take a step back and really savor the special moments—those
children will grow up sooner than you think!

More Info: Savory means appetizing or enjoyable. It can refer to foods that are pungent, salty, etc.
(any flavor but sweet) or to that which is morally respectable (a “dirty” joke could be called
unsavory). Although these uses are rarer, you can also savor a food by adding flavor to it, or even
use savor as a noun, as in “This soup has a wonderful savor.”

Definition: Obvious, apparent, plain to see (adj); a letter from a government guaranteeing an inventor
the rights to his or her invention (noun)

Usage: Her resume was full of patent lies: anyone could check to see that she had never been
president of UNICEF.

Related Words: Blatant means obvious or flagrant and is used to describe something bad (blatantly
disregarding the rules).

More Info: Patent comes from a Latin root for “openness,” also appearing in petal. A “letter patent”
was once an open letter, and this is the origin of “patent” as a record of idea ownership—if you have
a patent, there is an “open letter” (patent for all to see) attesting that your invention belongs to you.

Usage: The dictator was concerned about the people’s burgeoning discontent and redoubled his

Definition: Cheerfully optimistic, hopeful; reddish, ruddy (as in rosy-red cheeks indicting health or
vitality)

Usage: She had three papers due in three days, but she maintained her typically sanguine attitude.
“Things always just work out for me,” she said, happily.

Related Words: Chipper (cheerful, healthy and in good spirits)

More Info: Don’t confuse sanguine with sanguinary, which comes from the same root but means
“bloodthirsty”! The ancient Greeks thought that people were ruled by the “four humors”: blood,
yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm. A person with too much phlegm would be phlegmatic (sluggish,
gloomy); a person with too much bile would be bilious (bitter, mean); and a person ruled by blood
would be sanguine.

as in the kind a deceased person is buried in. (Not to be confused with hummus, the spread made
from chickpeas). Posthumous often describes the publication of books, the granting of awards or
military honors, or the birth of a child after the father’s death.

Predilection, Propensity, Proclivity, and Bent are all words for a preference or inclination (He has
an arrogant bent about him, and a propensity to offend others).

or “lightness” (as in lever, elevate), so you can think of raising money through taxes, raising an army
by drafting soldiers, or using that army to wage war.

                                      Also foreshadowing (noun)

Definition: Indicate or suggest beforehand, presage

Usage: You didn’t know this was a horror movie? I thought it was pretty clear that the children’s ghost
story around the campfire was meant to foreshadow the horrible things that would happen to them
years later as teenagers at a motel in the middle of the woods.

Related Words: Prefigure is a synonym. Forerun means run before or foreshadow. Harbinger and
Herald mean a person or thing that indicates what is to come (Herald can also mean “messenger,”
including about something in the past). Portentous and Ominous can mean “giving a bad sign about
the future” (portentous can also mean “very significant, exciting wonder and awe”).

More Info: “Fore” means “before”—foreshadow literally comes from the idea that an object’s
shadow sometimes arrives before the object does.

                                         Also languor (noun)

Definition: Drooping from exhaustion, sluggish, slow; lacking in spirit

Usage: We signed up for a fitness boot camp, but after a single hour of exercise in the heat, we all felt
so overcome with languor that we refused to go on. Turns out the reason we need a fitness boot camp
in the first place is that we’re pretty languid people.

Related Words: Torpid and slothful mean slow and lazy. Indolent means habitually lazy, such as a
person who chooses never to work. Lassitude is weariness or lack of caring.

More Info: Don’t confuse languor with langur, a type of monkey. Languorous is a more pleasant
version of languid, suggesting dreamy relaxation.

Definition: Using few words, concise

Usage: The boss was famously laconic; after allowing his employees to present their new plan for an
entire hour, he finally responded, “Confirmed.”

Related Words: Reticent and Taciturn (not talking much) are often used to describe shy people and
do not have the sense of “getting the point across efficiently” that laconic does. Pithy, however, takes
this idea even further—it means getting the point across in just a few, cleverly-chosen words.

More Info: Laconic comes from the Greek place named Laconia, the region in which Sparta (which
of course gives us spartan) was located. A famous story has an invading general threatening, “If I
enter Laconia, I will raze Sparta to the ground.” The Spartans laconically replied, “If.”

Usage: She might have been Teacher of the Year at work, but at home, her husband wished she would
turn off her didactic personality. “Honey,” he said, “I really don’t need you to use everything as a
learning opportunity.” / The child was disappointed when the storybook turned didactic in the end,
with the teddy bears—and the reader—being admonished never to lie.

Related Words: Pedagogical (pertaining to teaching), Pedantic (showy about learning, excessively
concerned with details, as in “He’s so pedantic he corrects his friends’ grammar.”)

More Info: Didactic can be positive or negative. Any teacher is didactic, but a person who is
lecturing or moralizing in an unwanted manner can also be called didactic.

Usage: That detective novel is hard to put down! I’ve got goosebumps just waiting to find out what
happens next! / You’ve got goosebumps—why don’t you borrow my jacket?

More Info: When a goose’s feathers are plucked, bumps are left behind on the skin. “Goose flesh” or

Definition: Something that restrains or discourages

Usage: Some argue that the death penalty is a deterrent to crime—that is, the point is not just to
punish the guilty, but to frighten other prospective criminals.

Related Words: Balk (an impediment; refuse to proceed or to do something)

More Info: As a military policy, deterrence is building military strength or ability to retaliate
(especially by stockpiling nuclear weapons, as in the Cold War) sufficient to deter enemies from

dispersed; or wordy and going off-topic)

More Info: Use disperse for something that spreads out and disappears (the crowd dispersed and

Usage: Do whatever you want—I’m indifferent. I won’t even notice.

More Info: Balk comes from a word for a beam or ridge—when a horse or mule balks, it stops short
and refuses to proceed. Occasionally, balk is used as a noun for an impediment, much like a beam or
ridge, or a defeat.

Definition: Economical, thrifty, not wasteful with money; inexpensive

drank water, ate salad, and requested a separate check—said she had never tried lobster.

Related Words: Provident (showing foresight, providing for the future, frugal), Stinting (frugal,
acting sparingly or with restraint)

More Info: Unlike a mere incongruity, which could be as innocent as one guy with a mohawk at an
otherwise straight-laced gathering, a discrepancy usually indicates that someone has done something
wrong. A discrepancy in your medical records means someone has made a mistake; a discrepancy in
your story means you’re lying.

Definition: Moderation, self-control, esp. regarding alcohol or other desires or pleasures; total abstinence from alcohol

Usage: After the end of the Civil War, economic change led to an increase in alcohol problems and the birth of the Temperance
Movement, which ultimately led to Prohibition. / Grandma is a model of temperance—she drinks red wine every night, but only the 1/3
of a glass that she read was conducive to preventing heart attacks.

Related Words: Teetotaler (person who doesn’t drink alcohol at all), Abstain (hold back, refrain, esp. from something bad or unhealthy),
Sobriety (temperance or the state of being sober; seriousness)

Usage: Wow, he’s such an eloquent speaker, he could sell snow to Antarcticans! / When Mom
suggested that everyone might enjoy a museum instead of the beach, she was met with the children’s
eloquent looks of disgust.

Related Words: Rhetorical and oratorical are words related to the art of public speaking. While a
lawyer needs good rhetorical skills, sometimes rhetorical and oratorical mean only related to style
and effect, and lacking substance. Eloquent, however, is always positive—even in the latter sentence
above, the eloquent looks of disgust are very effective in expressing the children’s feelings.

Usage: Most cop movies feature heroes who are maverick police officers, breaking all the rules,
blowing things up, and getting their guns confiscated by the chief—but ultimately saving the day.

Related Words: “Lone wolf” and “loose cannon” are expressions with similar meanings (although
“loose cannon” implies that the person might do something crazy or dangerous).

More Info: Samuel Maverick was an American pioneer who didn’t brand (that is, show ownership by
marking with a hot iron) his calves. In ranching lingo, a maverick is still an unbranded animal. Just as
a maverick calf doesn’t bear a mark of ownership, a political maverick doesn’t belong to any party.

and cocktails as though it’s your life mission.

Related Words: Sybarite (synonym). Voluptuary is also very similar, but adds the idea of seeking
luxury. Licentious (sexually unrestrained; immoral; ignoring the rules), Libertine (morally or sexually
unrestrained person; freethinker)

moral good, so whatever policy causes the most pleasure (and least pain) to the most people is the
most moral policy.

repeatedly

Definition: Prevent, eliminate, or make unnecessary

Usage: Adding protective heel taps to your dress shoes can obviate the need to take them to the shoe
repair store later, once the heels have worn down.

Related Words: Circumvent (go around, avoid, bypass, such as circumventing the rules)

More Info: It can be confusing that obviate looks so much like obvious but doesn’t seem related. The
words do share a root, and the common meaning is that something that is “in the way” is obvious
—and also takes some effort to avoid or obviate.

website so other cheaters could purchase it!

Related Words: Flagrant (shamelessly bad or offensive, obvious, notorious)

work in the second sentence above.

More Info: Of course, a New Year’s resolution is a decision to do something or make a change. Most
people aren’t resolved enough to keep their resolutions past January.

where two things are joined together

Usage: We are at a critical juncture in the history of this organization: either we can remain a
nonprofit, or we can register as a political action committee and try to expand our influence. / The

submissive way. Obsequious means “servile, very compliant, fawning.” Truckle means to act
subserviently and Kowtow means to fawn—or, literally, to bow until one’s forehead touches the floor.

since sixth grade summer camp.

Related Words: Slander, Traduce, and Defame all mean “to speak maliciously and falsely of.” Note,
however, that slander is always wrong (slanderous statements are, by definition, lies), whereas it is
possible (and sometimes for the greater good) to discredit someone by exposing the truth about that
person—for instance, a lying political candidate, or a fake “expert” giving damaging advice.

Definition: A harsh satire (noun); ridicule or satirize (verb)

Usage: “As a Democrat,” said Bob, “I can’t say I appreciated watching that comedian in the Obama
mask lampoon the State of the Union address.”

Related Words: To satirize is to use ridicule, sarcasm, etc. as a form of criticism. Parody is similar
but often not as harsh—the key difference is that a parody is actually a copy (the Scary Movie series
parodies the horror genre).

you’d probably be doing while watching a lampoon.

Definition: Reduce or lessen; shorten by omitting parts throughout while retaining the main idea

Usage: Our romantic vacation was abridged when the babysitter called to say that the kids were sick 
and we should come home. / Audio books are almost always abridged, since few people want to 
listen to a 200-hour book.

Related Words: Truncate (shorten by cutting off a part)
Memory Trick: When you abridge a book, you cut out sections from all over (hopefully without being 
too obvious)—that is, you create a bridge from the last part you kept in to the next part you kept in, so 
people don’t notice the missing bits. An abridged book still tells the whole story; a truncated book is 
missing the ending!

Definition: Having good judgment or insight; able to distinguish mentally

Usage: In an age in which we are bombarded with advertising, it’s important to be a discerning
consumer. For instance, the term “all natural” is not federally regulated and doesn’t have to mean
anything at all, so a smart shopper still reads ingredients.

Related Words: Keen, Perceptive, and Perspicacious are all related to having good judgment or
perception. Descry means to discover or see by looking carefully.

stupid person.

means “strengthen or support.”

More Info: Bolster comes from an Old Norse noun for a long, supportive pillow, and can still mean
this. Bolster has additional meanings in sailing, metalworking, and other fields, but in every case a
bolster is some kind of specialized support.

Definition: Concerning the appreciation of beauty or good taste, pertaining to the science of what is 
beautiful (adj); a sense of beauty and taste of a particular time and place (noun)

Usage: The twins were so different—one possessed a truly baroque aesthetic, preferring golden, 
gilded decor. The other lived in a world of pure logic, untouched by any aesthetic sense whatsoever; 
art did not move him, his house was bare, and he married his wife solely because she was a master of 
calculus.

More Info: The meaning of aesthetic can range from the academic study of beauty (aesthetics) to 
performing manicures, the work of an aesthetician. Don’t confuse aesthetic with ascetic (pertaining 
to a simple, austere life with no luxuries, such as that of a monk; a person who leads such a life).

Usage: The formal study of logic can enable a student to more easily identify fallacious reasoning
and, furthermore, to point out its fallacies.

Related Words: That which is fallacious definitely embodies a logical mistake, while that which is
fallible is capable of being wrong (but may not actually be).

More Info: Among the logical fallacies are the Ad Hominem Attack (attacking the person rather than

television “doctor” who turns out to have a Ph.D. in botany, for instance, ought to suffer a serious
drop in credibility.

More Info: The root “cred,” meaning “believe” also gives us credit, creed, credo, incredulous,
discredit, and accreditation. Don’t confuse credible with credulous, meaning gullible. Finally, while
we often use incredible to mean “great,” it really means “not believable.”

Definition: Be a name or symbol for

Usage: The company’s brand denotes quality; the marketing team has done a fantastic job of
associating the company’s image with fine service. / There’s nothing in the denotation of “crotchety”
(grumpy, having strong and irrational preferences) that indicates any particular group of people, but
due to the expression “crotchety old man,” the word connotes, for many people, an image of an
especially unpleasant male senior citizen.

More Info: A denotation is the literal meaning of a word; a connotation is the feeling that
accompanies that word. For instance, many special color words, such as “lilac” or “cerulean” have a
positive connotation.

Usage: “Thank you for this jacket that says ‘Eugene’s Girl,’” said Marie, “but I fear that your love
will prove to be ephemeral—over the last two years, I’ve seen four other girls in school with the
same jacket. Do you buy them in six-packs?”

Related Words: Evanescent and Fugacious are synonyms. Transient can mean “lasting only a short
time, temporary” or “staying only a short time,” or can be a noun referring to homeless people,

won’t not be boys there!”

Related Words: Dissembling (misleading, concealing the truth, acting hypocritically), Prevaricating
(misleading or lying)

More Info: Disingenuous appropriately describes misleading behavior that isn’t quite lying, like
when you say “Let’s do the dishes!” when you really mean “Why don’t you do the dishes?” The
opposite of disingenuous is ingenuous, or genuine.

in the rest of the company, sadly, only 4% of management positions are filled by women.

Related Words: Aberration (departing from normal; mental irregularity or deviation in morality)

Usage: I’m going to propose to Melinda tomorrow—sure, she has her peccadillos, like anyone, but
she’s the perfect woman for me.

More Info: “Pecado” is Spanish for “sin.” Adding “-illo” to a Spanish word indicates “small” (a
tomatillo resembles a small tomato, for instance). Thus, peccadillo means “small sin.” English
speakers pronounce the word like “armadillo,” although of course Spanish speakers would use a “y”
sound for the double l.

More Info: A contention is simply a claim, often a thesis or statement that will then be backed up
with reasons. To contend can be to argue or to vie for a prize, as in the famous quote from On the

treatment, patients never feel fully cured.

Related Words: Intransigent, Obdurate, and Obstreperous are also used to describe people who are
stubborn and hard to control.

your assistant, she has done everything you’ve asked her to do. / He doesn’t have his documents with
him, but I’ll warrant that he is indeed a certified forklift operator.

permission given to police by a judge to enter and search a suspect’s home.

Definition: Conjecture about an unknown by projecting information about something known; predict
by projecting past experience

Usage: No, I’ve never been to Bryn Mawr, but I’ve visited several small, private women’s colleges
in the Northeast, so I think I can extrapolate.

More Info: In math and science, to extrapolate is to infer values in an unobserved interval from
values in an observed interval. For instance, from the points (1, 4) and (3, 8), you could extrapolate
the point (5, 12), since it would be on the same line. The antonym of extrapolate is interpolate, to
estimate between two known values, such as by using (1, 4) and (3, 8) to assume (2, 6). Interpolate
can also mean “insert words or foreign material into a text or conversation.”

Definition: Characteristic of an earlier period, ancient, primitive

Usage: The school’s archaic computer system predated even floppy disks—it stored records on tape

Related Words: Obsolete (out of date, no longer used), Antediluvian (extremely old, before the 
Biblical flood)

More Info: “Archaic” is especially used to describe language common to an older time but rare

Definition: Of questionable authenticity; false

Usage: I’m sorry, but this putative letter from George Washington that you found at a garage sale is 
clearly apocryphal—it is riddled with anachronisms (for instance, Washington was long dead by the

Washington as “hey baby.”

Related Words: Ersatz (artificial, synthetic, serving as a substitute), Faux (fake, imitation, as in “faux 
fur”), Specious (pleasing to the eye but deceptive)

More Info: The word “Apocrypha” often refers to books that have been rejected for inclusion in 
(various versions of) the Bible, either due to dubious authenticity or because the Church considered

negate each one of their opponents’ major points in order to win.

Related Words: Nullify is to make void or invalid. Sap, Enfeeble, and Undermine all mean “weaken”

Related Words: Quotidian can simply mean daily, or can have the more negative meaning of
mundane.

More Info: Mundane comes from a root for “world” (the same root that gives us the Spanish el

Usage: Among the ranks of our alumni are two Senators and many famous authors.

sometimes the rank and file means all the regular soldiers (not the officers). Ranks also refers to
soldiers standing in a particular formation, so the expression to break rank means to rebel, disagree,
or disrupt a situation in which everyone is doing the same thing, as in The author broke rank with her
colleagues in the field of personal development by suggesting that “positive thinking” may be
doing more damage than good.

                                              SANK-shun

Definition: Permission or approval, something that gives support or authority to something else (noun); to allow, confirm, ratify (verb);
OR a legal action by one or more countries against another country to get it to comply (noun); to place sanctions or penalties on (verb)

Usage: Professional boxers may only fight in sanctioned matches—fighting outside the ring is prohibited. / America’s sanctions on
Cuba mean that it is illegal for Americans to do business with Cuban companies.

More Info: This word can be very confusing—its two definitions seem to be opposites. Allow and penalize? We have to use context to
figure out the meaning —since the bad meaning (generally “sanctions,” plural) applies to international actions, most usages of sanction
(regarding any other topic) mean “allow.” Sanction comes from the root for holy (also in sanctuary, sanctify, etc.). Imagine an ancient
society in which the ruler is also the spiritual leader, and it’s easy to imagine how legal sanctions could be thought of as “holy.”
