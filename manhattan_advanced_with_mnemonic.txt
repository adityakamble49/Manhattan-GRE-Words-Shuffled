Romans were fond of sacrificing animals to gain the gods’ favor), and therefore an endeavor is
propitious, or likely to be successful.

Definition: The rules governing grammar and how words join to make sentences (or how words and
symbols join in writing computer code), the study of these rules, or any system or orderly arrangement

Usage: Now that my linguistics class is studying syntax, it makes a little more sense when my
computer flashes “SYNTAX ERROR” at me. / Anyone learning a language is bound to make

                                       Also transgress (verb)

Definition: Violation of a law, moral rule, order, etc.; sin

Usage: His transgression was so serious that his family disowned him: no one would be visiting him
in prison.

Related Words: Contravene (violate, act counter to, oppose), Err (be mistaken, sin)

More Info: Transgress, from Latin, is literally “to step across,” similar to the expression “cross the
line,” as in You’ve really crossed the line this time. The “line,” of course, is a rule, principle, etc.

Mnemonic:
1. Trans + aggression....imagine the army of Pakistan aggressively crossing the Line of Control (LOC)
   and hence violating the law trans(=across) border.

Definition: Presume, suggest, put forward (an idea)

Usage: For thousands of years, philosophers have thought of the self as a unified entity, but
neuroscientists today posit the existence of a modular brain—a self that is a mix of different brain
parts, with no central “coordinator.”

Related Words: Postulate is a synonym. Assert and contend are stronger words for putting forth an
idea as true. To posit is sometimes as weak as merely introducing an idea for discussion, rather than
making a strong argument for it.

More Info: We pose a question, but we posit an idea.

Mnemonic:
1. Posit is short of positive, so we assume (posit) that something is true without being completely
   positive
2. posit: (pro)pose it. i.e propose or put forward
3. posit means put forward as fact or as a basis for argument...POSE+IT....why do we pose things or
   ourselves...to present ourselves......

but then spewed aspersions about him behind his back. / If you asperse me one more time, I will sue
you for libel!

Related Words: Slander, Traduce, and Defame all mean “to speak maliciously and falsely of”

More Info: Aspersions is often used in the phrase “to cast aspersions,” which has the sense of
throwing or tossing insults or malicious lies about someone. One additional (rare) meaning of
aspersion is “to sprinkle, such as for baptism.” So, it’s not a long leap to imagine spattering or
sprinkling someone with insults.

Related Words: Treacly and Saccharine are synonyms. Maudlin means “overly tearful and

Definition: Reckless, vicious, without regard for what is right; unjustifiable, deliberately done for no
reason at all; sexually unrestrained or excessively luxurious

Usage: Kids do like to play pranks on Halloween, but driving an SUV into people’s mailboxes isn’t a
prank—it’s wanton destruction of property. / Many hip-hip videos depict a wanton lifestyle that is
attractive to some, but unattainable (and possibly illegal). / During my grandmother’s adolescence in
Ireland, a girl might be sent off to a convent as punishment for “wanton ways,” such as being alone
with boys.

preschool class! If I had known, I could’ve addressed this issue before all the other parents

apprendre for good reason—both mean “to learn.” Don’t confuse apprise with appraise, which
means “to evaluate or assess the value of,” as in “to have jewelry appraised before selling it at
auction.”

Definition: Of the common people

Usage: I toured a luxury apartment building and I laughed when I saw that the apartments had
luxurious walk-in closets and whirlpool bathtubs—but hilariously tiny ovens. Because, of course, the
wealthy would never do something so plebian as cook their own food.

Related Words: Demotic (same root as democracy) is a more neutral word for “pertaining to the
people.” Plebian is negative, often used in a joking way—“Oh, sorry to interrupt your studying of that
opera libretto—I didn’t mean to imply that you’d do something so plebian as watch hockey with us.”
Populist is generally meant in a positive way, as in championing the rights and interests of regular
people.

More Info: The term plebe, used to describe the incoming class at a military school, is a variant of
plebian.

Definition: Marked by a strong point of view, biased

Usage: It’s hard to become absorbed in the world of a fantasy novel when the author is so
tendentious—the planet of Xerxon is clearly meant to mimic the United States, and the author’s
politics intrude on the story on every page.

Related Words: Partisan (partial to a particular party, group, etc., esp. in a biased, emotional way),
Bigot (obstinately prejudiced person)

More Info: A tendentious person is always tending towards some particular thing.

Mnemonic:
1. Rearrange the words to make - Tend or Tendency + ious or bias. So, TENDENTIOUS is a TENDENcy towards
   one viewpoint over another.

nugatory. Trivia (as in the questions on Jeopardy) is called that because the questions are about small
facts and details—that is, you never go on a trivia show and get asked about a nontrivial topic, like
the meaning of life.

Usage: Professor Knutsen’s friends joked that he became quite bombastic after a few drinks, once
asking a woman in a bar, “Is your daddy an aesthete? Because you are the epitome of ineffable

Related Words: Declamatory (pompous, merely oratorical), Magniloquent and Grandiloquent

Related Words: Dogmatic (close-minded, expressing one’s own opinions as though they were facts)

doctrine much too far.

Mnemonic:
1. Some Doctors are arrogant on their opinions when a junior suggest them.

                                             WHITE-wash

Definition: A substance used to whiten walls, wood, etc. (noun); deception, covering up of wrongs,
errors, misdeeds, etc. (verb)

Usage: The journalist accused the government of trying to whitewash the scandal, implying that the
officials covered up the incident out of concern for national security rather than to protect themselves.

Related Words: Gloss over, paper over, and whitewash are all expressions for covering up a
problem, insult, etc. rather than addressing it or fixing it. Because gloss is slippery (think of lip
gloss), gloss over often has the sense of trying to smoothly and quickly move on to something else, as
in “He made a snide remark about short people and then tried to gloss over it when he realized his
5’2” boss had overheard.”

Farrago, Potpourri, Pastiche and Olio are all words for mixtures of diverse things. Eclectic means
“selecting the best of everything or from many diverse sources” and thus is more positive than
pastiche, which indicates a sort of thrown-together mess of other people’s work.

sources. Pasticcio is also a pasta dish—the idea being “a mess” or scramble of pasta.

speaking with a rounded mouth.

Mnemonic:
1. ORE+TON....a person having tons of gold is either pompous or attractive...

project). An earmark is neutral, but a hallmark generally has more positive connotations.

More Info: The Goldsmiths’ Company of London made gold and silver articles stamped with a mark.
The company was located in Goldsmiths’ Hall—thus, a “hall mark.”

commitment by leaving provisions for withdrawal or changing one’s mind; protect a bet by also
betting on the other side), Palter (talk insincerely; bargain or haggle), Tergiversate (repeatedly

More Info: The Latin origin of equivocate is obvious—think of it as being “equally vocal” for two or
more positions.

Mnemonic:
1. equi(equal) vocal(sound)... if we make similar sounds then it would be ambiguous(unclear) to
   distinguish!!
2. equi+vocate sounds like advocate... corrupt advocates LIE, to CONCEAL THE TRUTH which MISLEADS the

Related Words: Primaveral or Vernal (relating to the spring; fresh, youthful)

More Info: Verdant is, of course, related to the Spanish verde and French vert for “green.” The color
green is also used figuratively—saying someone is “green” (much like a new spring plant) or “wet
behind the ears” (a reference to just being born) means the person is inexperienced.

Mnemonic:
1. Animals with BADA DANT eat greenery.

Usage: Bob said plastic surgery should be covered under the health care plan and Marion said it
shouldn’t, but it turns out that their disagreement was purely semantic—what Bob meant was
reconstructive surgery and what Marion meant was cosmetic surgery.

More Info: Semantic comes from a Greek root for “sign.” When an argument becomes muddled due
to language confusion, or when an arguer appears to be redefining a word rather than making a real
point, it is common to call the person’s remarks “mere semantics” or to say, “You’re just playing
semantics.”

Usage: The dashing rogue used flattery and lies to dupe several old ladies out of their money. “I feel
like a total dupe,” said Hazel Rosenbaum, 87. “I thought he and I were going to get married, but he
really just wanted my Social Security checks.”

Related Words: Hoodwink, Bilk, Swindle, Con, and Fleece are all verbs for cheating others. Fleece
is perhaps more severe, having the connotation of taking everything from the victim, the way one
sheers all of the fleece from a sheep.

More Info: Dupe comes from Old French duppe, a bird known for being very stupid. Dupe can also
be a short version of “duplicate,” although this meaning is somewhat informal and less likely on the
GRE.

Mnemonic:
1. duplicates(in movies) are used to fool people....

More Info: “Per” means “through” and “spic/spec” means “look” (as in spectacles, spectate, etc.)

Usage: The idea that we only use 10% of our brains is a tired, old canard; actually, even the dumbest
people use all of their brains.

Definition: Give a rough outline of; foreshadow; reveal only partially; obscure

Usage: When I took on the lead role in the movie, I agreed not to give away the plot, but I suppose I 
could give a brief adumbration of the premise.

More Info: Adumbrate contains the root “umbra,” Latin for “shadow.” It may seem that “give an 
outline of” and “obscure” are opposites, but think of it this way—to adumbrate is to give a shadowy, 
vague picture of something, which could mean giving more information (if starting with nothing) or 
obscuring information (if starting with a clear picture) in order to reach that point.

Mnemonic:
1. A dumb brat can't give the details - just a sketchy outline.
2. umbra means shadow, ad+umbra means to shadow the details, so the word means outline, to shadow,
   obscure and overshadow.
3. A+DUMB+REPRESENTATION=ADUMBRATION...imagine a dumb is giving you a representation...how will he do
   it???....represent in outline,indicate faintly...

Definition: Concerned with abstract thought, related to metaphysics (branch of philosophy concerned
with explaining the nature of being and of the world); very subtle or abstruse

Usage: My poetry class has all kinds. In contrast to Gary’s poetry about dogs and horses, Neil’s
poetry is very metaphysical, exploring the relation of mortal humans to a timeless universe. It’s a
little over Gary’s head.

Related Words: Ontology is part of metaphysics and is concerned with the investigation of the basic
categories of being and their relation to one another.

More Info: Metaphysics is much older than science—to the Greeks, all inquiry was “philosophy.”
Today, of course, science does a lot of the explaining of the world, so metaphysics can be understood
as a non-empirical study of those topics. Empirical means “based on experience or experimentation;
not purely based on theory.”

Mnemonic:
1. meta + physics -> suffix 'meta' means change.. so if physics keeps changing, it means the topic is
   only theoretical and cannot be proved practically..
2. meta = data about ~ data about physics? means to understand and study existence of life and nature
   of reality

                                               FUR-tiv

Definition: Done secretly; stealthy, sly, shifty

Usage: As a spokesperson for a popular diet plan, the actress had to be quite furtive about eating junk
food, even hiding her M&Ms in a breath mint container lest the paparazzi snap photos of the inside of
her car.

Related Words: Clandestine, Covert, and Surreptitious all mean secret, undercover. Furtive contains
the added sense of doing something wrong. For instance, the National Clandestine Service is part of
the CIA, and military units regularly engage in covert operations. It is unlikely, though, that a
government would ever use furtive in the name of its departments or operations, due to the word’s
negative associations. Furtive, in fact, comes from a Latin word for “thief.”

Mnemonic:
1. One who is FARTive has to expel farts stealthily.
2. FURTIVE ..very close to FERTILE...SO when you are infertile you go for fertility treatment, which
   you keep SECRET from others, as you dont want people to know about your infertility.

generosity)

More Info: Word origins sometimes contain biases or old-fashioned ideas—for instance, the
implication that people on islands are narrow-minded. A similar bias is implied in provincial and
parochial (pertaining to a province or parish, respectively)—the idea is that people from “out there
in the country” are not as sophisticated as city people, who have their own word, urbane
(cosmopolitan, refined).

Mnemonic:
1. diffident = difficult to be confident
2. The root DI- means lacking. The root FIDE- (like FIDElity) means trust. Therefore, DIFFIDENT means

Definition: Extremely impractical but very romantic, chivalrous, or idealistic; impulsive

would do if elected President. The plans were adorably quixotic, involving housing all the homeless
in floating homes on the ocean, or teaching everyone to be nice to each other.

More Info: From Cervantes’ 1791 novel Don Quixote, about a romantic, impractical hero who
becomes obsessed with books about chivalry (believing even the most ridiculous tales within the
books) and famously attacks windmills he believes to be giants—hence the expression “tilting at
windmills,” meaning fighting unwinnable battles or battles against imaginary foes.

Mnemonic:
1. quixotic== quick + exotic, if you desire something exotic to happen quickly in your life it is just
   a daydream.

   NOVEL..Cervantes GETS inspired by lofty and chivalrous but impractical ideals....................
3. divide it as quix(quick)+otic..
4. quixotic=quick+sotic(sortic)...if u sort out things quickly without thinking u ll be FOOLISH AND
   IMPRACTICAL
5. if we divide quixotic, we will notice xotic which is similar to exotic which mean unusual
6. Quick so thick....He is Quick and so thick(fat here)...which is unrealistic.

More Info: Noisome isn’t really about noise! (The word shares a root with “annoy”). The GRE is not

cacophonous or dissonant).

Mnemonic:
1. Try to extract out two words from it... <ol style="padding-

Definition: Calm, not able to be upset or agitated

Usage: Having seen pretty much everything, the kindergarten teacher was truly imperturbable: a

didn’t bother her in the least.

Related Words: Impervious (impenetrable, not able to be harmed or emotionally disturbed, as in
“impervious to criticism”), Stoic (not having or showing feeling, esp. in response to suffering)

More Info: Of course, a person who can be upset is perturbable and has been perturbed. Perturb
contains a root from the Latin “turbare” (to disturb); this root also appears in turbulence and turbid
(muddy and choppy, as a turbulent body of water).

Mnemonic:
1. imperturbabble--im + pertur (like tur tur) + babble ( just talking foolishly..). So, the person who
   never do any tur-tur and never babbles is a very cool, calm and peaceful guy.
2. im-'not'+perturb(able), meaning not perturbed....so a person who is not perturbed stays calm and
   placid.
3. imperturbable- im+perturbable. Perturb has a rhythm with Disturb. Imperturbable is a person whom u
   can't feel disturbed/upset easily- that's why he is always calm.
4. imperturbable = imperturbare (old) = im- 'not' + per-'completely' + turbare (sounds like disturb)
5. Im+Pester+Able.
6. Im(Not) + per( permiable) + tub(turbulance) , so not prone to turbulance,so marked by extreme calm

executives to review.

Related Words: Digest (a periodical containing shortened versions of works published elsewhere),
Recapitulation (summary or the act of summing up), Précis (summary or abstract), Compendium
(concise but complete summary; a list or collection)

More Info: The root “sym/syn” means “together” and “op” comes from a Latin root for “eye”
(optometrist, optical, ocular, myopia). Thus, synoptic literally means “see all together,” which is
what a good summary allows you to do.

policies about it.

Related Words: Declaim (speak in an impassioned, pompous, or oratorical manner; give a formal
speech)

More Info: As a noun, a grandstand is essentially “the bleachers,” so to grandstand is to perform as
though for bleachers full of onlookers. In a memorable episode of 30 Rock, Queen Latifah’s character,
a Senator, grandstands by making animated nonsense speeches in which she just shouts “America”
and “the future” and “the troops” so passionately that everyone applauds.

Flout comes from Middle English “flouten,” meaning “to play the flute.” Apparently it was once

helpless female leads, whereas the romantic comedies of the 1940s featured plucky heroines who
took the lead in cleverly solving problems. / While the police hit a dead end, a band of plucky
children was able to find the stolen bicycle.

More Info: Plucky (along with synonym spunky) is a rather “cute” word for courageous. It is
appropriate for children and for people dealing with fairly minor situations in a bold, clever way.
Some find it sexist when applied to adult women in professional or otherwise serious situations; it is
almost never applied to men. Plucky would be very inappropriate to describe a soldier in battle, a
hero of the Civil Rights movement, etc. Use a word like courageous or intrepid instead.

(insincere, not genuine), Equivocate (use unclear language to deceive or avoid committing to a
position)

More Info: As you can see, we have many words in English that mean something just short of lying—
probably because there are many situations in which we need to point out a lie, but want to do so as
politely or discreetly as we can; all of the above words are less blunt than lie.

Mnemonic:
1. divide is as pre(..before)+var(truth..)+icate(..gate) ..i.e. before truth, you have kept a gate.
   Hence you are LYING or HIDING THE TRUTH..

More Info: Perennial plants last more than one year, as opposed to annuals, which must be replanted
every year. “Per” means “through” and the “ennial” part of the word is really just a variant on
“annual,” so perennial literally means “through the years.”

Mnemonic:
1. if you remember we have learnt about perennial rivers in social studies which means LONG LASTING
   rivers

preferred rustic furniture; her dining room chairs were little more than stumps roughly hewn into
stools.

More Info: The past tense of hew is hewn, and the expression roughly hewn (or rough-hewn, or
rough hewed) is often used to describe something that seems unfinished or looks as though it was
“carved” with a heavy axe rather than more delicate tools. For instance, a manly-man movie star—
someone like Russell Crowe—is a more roughly hewn than someone like Zac Efron.

Mnemonic:
1. CHEW- when you chew, you try to chop the thing with your teeth.
