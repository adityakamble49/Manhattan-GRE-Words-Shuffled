agree, although the word is generally not offensive when discussing science and medicine; the NY
Times has recently referred to “distaff subjects” in a medical study.

place of “ameliorate” in the sentence above.

More Info: Ameliorate occasionally appears as meliorate (an Old English version), meaning exactly

—a lucid argument, a lucid person. Pellucid usually means literally transparent, as above. Limpid
means clear, transparent, or completely calm.

More Info: The prefix “pel” or “per” means “through” and often doesn’t change the meaning of the
other root parts that much (for instance, fervid means passionate and perfervid means really
passionate). You can think of the pel/per prefix as similar to the English expression “through and
through.”

section seems grafted on, almost as though written by a different author. / It’s not cool for your boss
to pressure you into buying Girl Scout cookies from his daughter. If she were selling something larger,
we’d call that graft.

More Info: The “skin graft” sense of graft is related to the root “graph,” for a writing or carving tool.
This root also appears in graffiti, cartography (mapmaking), epigraph (inscription on a building,
statue, etc.), and even cacography (bad spelling or handwriting).

Usage: The speaker argued that humanity had traded the yoke of servitude to kings and tyrants for the
yoke of consumerism, which enslaves us just as much in the end.

someone’s honor, etc.; rent, tax, etc. paid by a subject to a lord)

More Info: Under the feudal system, a vassal was required to pay homage to his lord. The word

Usage: For saying that the Sun and not the Earth was the center of the universe, Galileo was brought

forced recantation doesn’t say much about whether the person really abjures his former views.

sprinkling someone with insults.

jewelry looks gaudy). Meretricious means attractive in a vulgar or flashy way, tawdry; deceptive.

More Info: This etymology is ridiculous—tawdry comes from a mispronun-ciation of “St. Audrey,”

because of her love of necklaces.

in “The bottom of the boat rasped the rocky ocean floor.” A person with a sore throat often has a
raspy voice.

More Info: A grate, of course, can also be a frame of bars, such as to secure a window. A cheese

someone like Russell Crowe—is a more roughly hewn than someone like Zac Efron.

Definition: Cheat or defraud

Usage: The con artist bilked many elderly people out of their savings, promising to cure illnesses
from diabetes to cancer with only 36 monthly payments of $99.99—for which the victims received

all of the fleece from a sheep.

More Info: Bilk can also be a noun for the person who cheats others (“I hope that bilk goes to jail!”)
More obscurely, bilk can mean to escape from, frustrate, or thwart. The word comes from the card

the “vari” part is the same as in various, so it shouldn’t be hard to figure out a synonym like
varicolored.

Imagine a man telling a woman she is the epitome of pulchritude. Unless she has a very good
vocabulary, it probably won’t go very well.

Definition: A leader who lies and gains power by arousing the passions and especially prejudices of
the people

perspicacity.

Related Words: A Propagandist or Provocateur influences the public in ways that are probably more
emotional than logical.

exigent problem, the boss risked a serious lawsuit by doing what was expedient instead of what was
right.”

Definition: Lowest point

Usage: It was only when Ming reached her absolute nadir—what her recovery program called “rock
bottom”—that she admitted she had a problem and checked herself into rehab.

Related Words: The opposite of the nadir is the zenith, or highest point. Both words are terms from
astronomy, referring to points directly below and above the observer on an imaginary sphere on
which celestial bodies appear to be projected. On the GRE, these words will be used metaphorically
—the nadir of one’s struggles, the zenith (or acme, pinnacle, or summit) of one’s success.

More Info: Finally, a GRE word from Arabic! Nadir comes through Latin from the Arabic nazir,
“opposite to”—here, the nadir is opposite the zenith.

Definition: Person who deserts a party, cause, religion, etc.

Usage: Many people considered “freedom fighters” by some are considered apostates by others; 
some women’s rights leaders in very conservative nations receive death threats from religious 
leaders who consider them apostate.

Related Words: Recreant (coward or deserter), Perfidy (faithlessness, treachery), Heretic (believer 
who disagrees with religious authorities; any nonconformist thinker), Quisling (person who betrays

Definition: Rule by the wealthy

Usage: There have always been rich and poor people, of course, but some argue that the U.S. is
becoming a plutocracy, with the richest 10% controlling two-thirds of the nation’s wealth and nearly
half of our Congressional representatives being millionaires.

Related Words: A plutocracy might also be an oligarchy (rule by only a few).

More Info: In Greek mythology, Pluto (also known as Hades) was god of the underworld, and Plutus
was god of wealth. Things got a bit confused over the years, as people used “Plutus” to mean “Pluto”
as a way to make things sound a little more positive.

Related Words: Abash (destroy the confidence of, make ashamed, disconcert), Disquiet (disturb or
cause anxiety to, as in “The anonymous phone message disquieted him.”)

More Info: Discomfit originally meant “defeat in battle” but today is closer to disconcert—possibly,
over the years, people confused discomfit and discomfort, causing the shift in meaning.

Definition: Riotous, violently agitated, marked by disturbance or uproar; noisy, chaotic

Usage: Poland’s tumultuous history includes a Nazi invasion, a period of Soviet rule, and, well
before that, over 120 years during which it was partitioned by Russia, Prussia, and Austria and
simply didn’t exist. / She had been enjoying the game, but lost her hat, left earring, and keys in the
tumult that resulted when fans went crazy over a referee’s call.

Usage: For thousands of years, philosophers have thought of the self as a unified entity, but
neuroscientists today posit the existence of a modular brain—a self that is a mix of different brain
parts, with no central “coordinator.”

Related Words: Postulate is a synonym. Assert and contend are stronger words for putting forth an

making a strong argument for it.

rising or surging again)

More Info: Recrudescent shares a root (meaning “raw”) with crudité, vegetables served raw. It

Definition: Concerned with abstract thought, related to metaphysics (branch of philosophy concerned
with explaining the nature of being and of the world); very subtle or abstruse

Usage: My poetry class has all kinds. In contrast to Gary’s poetry about dogs and horses, Neil’s
poetry is very metaphysical, exploring the relation of mortal humans to a timeless universe. It’s a
little over Gary’s head.

Related Words: Ontology is part of metaphysics and is concerned with the investigation of the basic
categories of being and their relation to one another.

More Info: Metaphysics is much older than science—to the Greeks, all inquiry was “philosophy.”
Today, of course, science does a lot of the explaining of the world, so metaphysics can be understood
as a non-empirical study of those topics. Empirical means “based on experience or experimentation;
not purely based on theory.”

given to odd notions), Cantankerous (disagreeable, contentious), Crank (an unbalanced person who
is fanatical about a private, generally petty cause)

meaning is surely still in line with the behavior of many noblemen towards their servants.

Definition: Perform showily in an attempt to impress onlookers

Usage: I was really passionate about the candidate when he spoke at our school, but now that I think
about it, he was just grandstanding. I mean, who could disagree that young people are the future?
And doing a cheer for the environment doesn’t actually signify a commitment to change any public
policies about it.

Related Words: Declaim (speak in an impassioned, pompous, or oratorical manner; give a formal
speech)

More Info: As a noun, a grandstand is essentially “the bleachers,” so to grandstand is to perform as
though for bleachers full of onlookers. In a memorable episode of 30 Rock, Queen Latifah’s character,
a Senator, grandstands by making animated nonsense speeches in which she just shouts “America”
and “the future” and “the troops” so passionately that everyone applauds.

Definition: Native, local; natural, specific to, or confined to a particular place

Usage: Certain diseases—especially those that require a precise mix of environmental conditions and
local plant and animal life to thrive—remain endemic to particular regions.

Related Words: The antonym of endemic is pandemic, “widespread, universal,” also generally of a
disease or something bad.

More Info: Endemic contains the Greek “en” (in) and “demos” (people). Don’t confuse endemic with
epidemic, which means “rapidly spreading” and is a near-synonym with pandemic.

person)

Usage: Every time their religious sister ran out of money, help always arrived! She viewed this as
God’s providential hand, but her family members viewed it as their always having to bail her out,
and it was getting annoying.

Related Words: Propitious (favorable, giving good signs for the future, likely to work out; kind or
forgiving), Auspicious (looking as though success is likely)

More Info: Provident means showing foresight, being frugal or careful to provide for the future,
thinking ahead in a wise way. Often this quality is attributed to God (or nature), so providence

Definition: Relating to the different meanings of words or other symbols

Usage: Bob said plastic surgery should be covered under the health care plan and Marion said it
shouldn’t, but it turns out that their disagreement was purely semantic—what Bob meant was
reconstructive surgery and what Marion meant was cosmetic surgery.

More Info: Semantic comes from a Greek root for “sign.” When an argument becomes muddled due
to language confusion, or when an arguer appears to be redefining a word rather than making a real
point, it is common to call the person’s remarks “mere semantics” or to say, “You’re just playing

Definition: Mix of incongruous parts; artistic work imitating the work of other artists, often
satirically

Usage: The slickly-produced boy band’s first album was deeply unimaginative, just a pastiche of
every other boy band album ever produced.

Related Words: Heterogeneous means “made up of diverse elements.” Hodgepodge, Medley,
Farrago, Potpourri, Pastiche and Olio are all words for mixtures of diverse things. Eclectic means
“selecting the best of everything or from many diverse sources” and thus is more positive than
pastiche, which indicates a sort of thrown-together mess of other people’s work.

More Info: From the Italian pasticcio, something made by mixing borrowed elements from other
sources. Pasticcio is also a pasta dish—the idea being “a mess” or scramble of pasta.

tendentious—the planet of Xerxon is clearly meant to mimic the United States, and the author’s
politics intrude on the story on every page.

delectable and delicious.

Usage: I’m not surprised they got divorced—you can’t upbraid someone every time he forgets to put a
water glass in the sink and then expect him to stick around.

Related Words: Admonish means scold or mildly criticize. Reprove, Reproach, Reprimand, Rebuke,
Excoriate, and Castigate are all words for criticizing or scolding more harshly. Censure means
strong disapproval or official reprimand.

More Info: Upbraid is related to braid (intertwined hair)—the root relates to twisting, darting, or
being quick (such as in battle). The idea is that, when you upbraid someone, you bring up his or her
faults quickly and sharply—almost as a weapon. Of course, now we’re imagining braided hair
twisting like a sneaky enemy.

                                              WAHN-tuhn

Definition: Reckless, vicious, without regard for what is right; unjustifiable, deliberately done for no
reason at all; sexually unrestrained or excessively luxurious

Usage: Kids do like to play pranks on Halloween, but driving an SUV into people’s mailboxes isn’t a
prank—it’s wanton destruction of property. / Many hip-hip videos depict a wanton lifestyle that is
attractive to some, but unattainable (and possibly illegal). / During my grandmother’s adolescence in
Ireland, a girl might be sent off to a convent as punishment for “wanton ways,” such as being alone
with boys.

lacking (as in, I read the book and found it wanting).

strategy), Finesse (use tact or diplomacy; employ a deceptive strategy), Duplicity (deceit, double-
dealing, acting in two different ways for the purpose of deception), Wily (crafty, cunning)

Definition: Brave, spirited

Usage: Feminist critics have commented that today’s romantic comedies tend to feature passive,
helpless female leads, whereas the romantic comedies of the 1940s featured plucky heroines who
took the lead in cleverly solving problems. / While the police hit a dead end, a band of plucky
children was able to find the stolen bicycle.

More Info: Plucky (along with synonym spunky) is a rather “cute” word for courageous. It is
appropriate for children and for people dealing with fairly minor situations in a bold, clever way.
Some find it sexist when applied to adult women in professional or otherwise serious situations; it is
almost never applied to men. Plucky would be very inappropriate to describe a soldier in battle, a
hero of the Civil Rights movement, etc. Use a word like courageous or intrepid instead.

Related Words: Ambivalent (uncertain; unable to decide, or wanting to do two contradictory things at
once), Equivocal (allowing for several different meanings; undecided or having mixed feelings)

Definition: Charging interest on a loan, esp. charging illegally high or excessive interest

Usage: I can’t see how that payday lending place is even legal—a person borrowing $100 will end
up paying over $150 interest in just a few months! Isn’t that usury? I don’t know how that place is
skirting the law.

More Info: Usury is always bad. Whether it means simply charging interest or charging way too much
depends on the time and place. In medieval times when all moneylending was illegal, usury meant
any charging of interest; today, usury laws specify exactly how much interest it’s allowable to charge.

facts and details—that is, you never go on a trivia show and get asked about a nontrivial topic, like
the meaning of life.

Definition: Full, rich, and clear (of the voice or speaking); pompous, bombastic

ear), Mellifluous (richly and smoothly flowing, as “a mellifluous voice”), Stentorian (loud)

More Info: Rotund simply means rounded—when applied to a person, it’s a somewhat more polite
word than “fat.” The connection is the idea of “roundness”—orotund comes from the idea of
speaking with a rounded mouth.

Definition: Controversial argument, esp. one attacking a specific idea

Usage: Laura Kipnis’ 2003 book Against Love: A Polemic has been called “shocking” and
“scathing.” Perhaps Kipnis used the word polemic in the title to indicate that she’s making an extreme
argument as a means of starting a debate. After all, who’s really against love?

in “The prize winner’s windfall more than solved his mortgage problem.”)

More Info: A fluke can also be a flatworm (a “liver fluke”), type of fish, anchor blade, barbed
arrowhead, or even a lobe of a whale’s tail. What all of these objects have in common is being flat
(the old Germanic root means flat). The origin of fluke as a “stroke of good luck” is unknown—
having flukes parasitizing your liver, for instance, sounds incredibly unlucky.

and sent him back to class.

hide for a bad reason, such as avoiding work (or waiting to attack someone, etc.)

More Info: “Mal” means “bad,” and although malinger doesn’t actually come from linger (stick
around, stay due to not wanting to leave), the idea of sticking around in a bad way (like malingerer
Joey, above) is a good way to remember malinger.

people.” Plebian is negative, often used in a joking way—“Oh, sorry to interrupt your studying of that
opera libretto—I didn’t mean to imply that you’d do something so plebian as watch hockey with us.”
Populist is generally meant in a positive way, as in championing the rights and interests of regular
people.

Insolent (bold in a rude way), Brazen (shameless, contemptuously bold)

Related Words: Auspicious (looking as though success is likely), Opportune (suitable, convenient,
occurring at an appropriate time)
Memory Trick: It’s a bit confusing that propitiate means “attempt to reconcile with, satisfy, or reduce
the animosity of.” Perhaps it would help to imagine that the gods have already been propitiated (the
Romans were fond of sacrificing animals to gain the gods’ favor), and therefore an endeavor is
propitious, or likely to be successful.

instance, the hind limbs of whales and snakes, and the tailbone in humans. Thus, when a baby is born
with a protruding tailbone, it is called a vestigial tail (as featured in the 2001 film Shallow Hal).

Usage: Pretending to be the building’s landlord, the shyster was able to hoodwink eleven people into
paying deposits on a vacant apartment—of course, he absconded with the money, leaving the victims
without their money or a place to live.

or exploit.” Fleece is perhaps more severe, having the connotation of taking everything from the
victim, the way one sheers all of the fleece from a sheep.

Definition: Give a rough outline of; foreshadow; reveal only partially; obscure

Usage: When I took on the lead role in the movie, I agreed not to give away the plot, but I suppose I

outline of” and “obscure” are opposites, but think of it this way—to adumbrate is to give a shadowy, 
vague picture of something, which could mean giving more information (if starting with nothing) or 
obscuring information (if starting with a clear picture) in order to reach that point.

Related Words: Ameliorate, Mitigate, Alleviate, and Extenuate also refer to lessening something bad
without eliminating it.

More Info: Palliate comes from the Latin “pallium,” a cloak, which covers up. To palliate a crime is
to try to make it seem not as bad, such as by introducing extenuating circumstances.

is perhaps more severe, having the connotation of taking everything from the victim, the way one
sheers all of the fleece from a sheep.

More Info: Dupe comes from Old French duppe, a bird known for being very stupid. Dupe can also
be a short version of “duplicate,” although this meaning is somewhat informal and less likely on the

fallow, and the world never benefit from their genius.

Related Words: Another GRE word related to farming is arable, which means “able to be farmed,

of rural life and songs or poems on that theme.

“racial epithet” is a slur and is always bad.

and parental machinations.

Related Words: Collude (conspire; cooperate for illegal or fraudulent purposes), Cabal (a
conspiratorial group)

government). It’s just a coincidence that machinations looks a little like Machiavelli, but

Usage: “I’m old, not dead!” said Grandpa Albert, full of vim and ready for his first bungee jump.

Related Words: Vigor (synonym), Verve (vigor, spirit, liveliness), Sprightly (vivacious, full of life)

every year. “Per” means “through” and the “ennial” part of the word is really just a variant on
“annual,” so perennial literally means “through the years.”

his inherited wealth as an excuse to sunbathe and party.

by analyzing the businesses themselves) consider others’ attempts to “time the market” as mere
augury, equivalent to trying to predict rain by reading tea leaves.

errors, misdeeds, etc. (verb)

Usage: The journalist accused the government of trying to whitewash the scandal, implying that the
officials covered up the incident out of concern for national security rather than to protect themselves.

Related Words: Gloss over, paper over, and whitewash are all expressions for covering up a
problem, insult, etc. rather than addressing it or fixing it. Because gloss is slippery (think of lip
gloss), gloss over often has the sense of trying to smoothly and quickly move on to something else, as
in “He made a snide remark about short people and then tried to gloss over it when he realized his

                                         Also pedantic (adj)

Definition: Person who pays excessive attention to book learning and rules, or who uses his or her
learning to show off

Usage: I hate when pedants interrupt you to correct your grammar, especially if what you’re saying is
important—and in my opinion, almost anything is more important than pedantic quibbles over
whether it’s okay to end a sentence with a preposition.

Related Words: Didactic means “intended to instruct; teaching, or teaching a moral lesson.” This is a
perfectly positive quality for a teacher, but could be annoying coming from a peer. Fastidious means
“excessively particular, hard to please.”

More Info: “Ped” means “child,” as in pediatrician. A pedant was once a schoolmaster; now it’s
someone who acts like a schoolmaster in inappropriate situations.

—“Whatever happens, happens,” he said.

Related Words: Stoic (not having or showing feeling, esp. in response to suffering), Inscrutable (not
able to be scrutinized, mysterious).

More Info: Note that impassive is NOT the antonym of passive, which means “inactive, not reacting.”

Definition: Person with cultivated, refined tastes, esp. in food and wine

Usage: A true epicure, he served only the finest wines, and bragged about how the pancetta was
imported from Italy and the Stilton cheese from the English countryside.

Related Words: Connoisseur (expert, especially in the fine arts; person of educated, refined tastes),
Discriminating (judicious, discerning, having good insight)

More Info: The Epicureans were Greek philosophers who did indeed hold that human pleasure was
the highest good, although they believed that a simple life was key to that pleasure. Don’t confuse
modern epicures with hedonists, or those devoted to pleasure—one way to think of the difference is
that, if your parents are epicures, you probably grew up eating very well, but if your parents are
hedonists, you probably don’t want to know about it.

Definition: Pertaining to motion

Usage: Marisa told her mother what she had learned in science class: a ball sitting on a table has
potential energy, but a ball falling towards the ground has kinetic energy.

More Info: Kinetic contains a root for motion that appears in many other words that you don’t need to
memorize, but now can easily puzzle out—kinesthetic learners prefer to learn through physical
activity. Patients with dyskenesia have trouble with movement. You could major in kinesiology in
preparation for being a coach or gym teacher.

related to laughing), Jocular, Jocund, or Jocose (jesting, jolly), Droll (funny in an odd way)

More Info: Don’t confuse fatuous with facetious, meaning “joking, humorous, esp. inappropriately.”
Facetious people can be smartly sarcastic; fatuous people are dull and dim-witted. Fatuous comes
from a word for gaping—as in, having one’s mouth hang open like a very stupid person.

Usage: He is such a jingoist that he’s always yelling at the TV, calling even the most conservative
commentators “wimps” for failing to suggest that we simply nuke, burn, pillage, and otherwise
extirpate our so-called “enemies.”

Related Words: Hawkish (advocating war), Chauvinism (fanatical patriotism or blind enthusiasm for
military glory; undue or biased devotion to any group, cause, etc.)

cosmopolite (someone who considers him or herself a citizen of the entire world).

Definition: Journeying from place to place; traveling on foot

Usage: He quit his office job to become a peripatetic musician, traveling from town to town playing
in bars and sleeping on couches.

Related Words: Itinerant and wayfaring are synonyms. Peregrinate is a verb for being peripatetic.
Transient also means moving around, but is more associated with homeless people or those on the
fringe of society (whereas itinerant is more associated with people who travel for a job).

More Info: “Peri” means around (as in perimeter) and the rest comes from a Latin word meaning “to
walk.” Peripatetic was originally associated with Aristotle’s school of philosophers, who would
walk while teaching.

Definition: Very passionate, devoted, or enthusiastic

Usage: He was an ardent heavy metal lover and became offended anytime someone referred to
Poison as a “hair band.” / They were so in love that not even meeting each other’s awful relatives
could dampen their ardor.

Related Words: Fervent, Fervid, and Perfervid all mean “passionate, fiery, deeply enthusiastic” and
come from a common root relating to heat.

More Info: Don’t confuse ardor with arduous, which means very difficult. Ardor comes from a Latin
word meaning “to burn”, which we can think of here in the sense of “burning with passion.”

Definition: Tear violently, esp. to tear one’s clothing or hair out of grief; pull apart, split, or tear
away

Usage: Many figures in the Bible rent their clothing from grief at a loved one’s death, an event that
can surely rend one’s heart as well.

charities for all the good work they did.

Related Words: Benevolent (expressing goodwill, helping others or charity), Eleemosynary
(charitable)

More Info: The Latin root “bene” means “good,” and “fic” means “making or producing.” The

Usage: When people asked the twenty-five year old bride what had attracted her to her commanding,
sixty year old CEO husband, she replied that she had always been drawn to puissance. That tended to

for earth also appears in terrestrial, terrarium, terrace, territory, Mediterranean, and extra-

/ The first-year associate was a little too verdant to be assigned to the big case.

Related Words: Primaveral or Vernal (relating to the spring; fresh, youthful)

More Info: Verdant is, of course, related to the Spanish verde and French vert for “green.” The color
green is also used figuratively—saying someone is “green” (much like a new spring plant) or “wet
behind the ears” (a reference to just being born) means the person is inexperienced.

enter sixth grade, or as the land grades into the sea, egress involves a shift in position. The opposite
of egress is ingress, meaning “entering.”

position)

More Info: As you can see, we have many words in English that mean something just short of lying—

                               eye-TIN-uh-rare-ee or it-TIN-uh-rare-ee

Definition: Travel schedule; detailed plan for a journey

Usage: Great, that was the Parthenon! What’s next on our itinerary?

Related Words: Agenda is a similar but more general word that can be used metaphorically—a
meeting usually has an agenda, a trip could have an agenda (goal or plan) for the day, and a person
who wants something but isn’t being direct about it is said to have an agenda or hidden agenda.

More Info: Itinerary shares a root with itinerant (traveling from place to place, esp. as part of a
job). An itinerary can sometimes be a guidebook or a record of travel that has already happened.

                                        Also distended (adj)

Definition: Swell, expand, stretch, bloat

Usage: The emergency room doctor constantly saw people who came in with distended bellies, sure
that they had appendicitis; usually, it was just gas.

                                          per-FUNK-tuh-ree

Definition: Done superficially, without much care, or merely as routine

Usage: She did a really perfunctory job on this Powerpoint. Sure, it has a dozen slides, but most of
them just say things like “Sales—Ways to Improve” in Times New Roman on a white background.
Maybe she’s planning to fill in the details later.

Related Words: Cursory (quick and superficial, as in a cursory glance at the report)

More Info: “Per” means “through” and the rest of perfunctory comes from the same place as
“function”—think of perfunctory as trying to get through performing a function as quickly as
possible.

Usage: The new assistant chef received some rather pungent criticism from the head chef for her idea
to make feta cheese soup, which the customers found much too pungent.

Related Words: Acerbic (sour; harsh or severe), Acrid (sharp or biting, pungent), Astringent (caustic,
biting, severe; a skin cleaning fluid that clears pores), Caustic (capable of corroding metal or burning
the skin; very critical or sarcastic)

Definition: Pertaining to glaciers; cold, icy, slow, unsympathetic

Usage: He had wanted to appear in the singing reality competition his whole young life, but he was
not encouraged by the judges’ glacial response to his audition. The awkward silence was excruciating
as he waited for the stony-faced panel to say anything at all.

Related Words: Frigid (very cold, without human warmth or emotion), Gelid (icy)

More Info: A very obvious metaphor—glaciers are cold, slow, and (naturally) don’t have feelings. A
person who acts like a glacier is unpleasant indeed.

departure from his usual fiery homilies railing against iniquity. / Iniquitous corporations, such as

Definition: Flood, cover with water, overwhelm

Usage: As the city was inundated with water, the mayor feared that many evacuees would have
nowhere to go. / I can’t go out—I am inundated with homework!

Related Words: Deluge means to flood, or a flood itself, and is used metaphorically in the same way
as inundate (deluged with work, a deluge of complaints). Engulf means “flow over and enclose,
swallow up or submerge.” A storm engulfing an island would be even more severe than a storm
inundating or deluging it.

                                               FUR-tiv

Definition: Done secretly; stealthy, sly, shifty

Usage: As a spokesperson for a popular diet plan, the actress had to be quite furtive about eating junk
food, even hiding her M&Ms in a breath mint container lest the paparazzi snap photos of the inside of
her car.

Related Words: Clandestine, Covert, and Surreptitious all mean secret, undercover. Furtive contains
the added sense of doing something wrong. For instance, the National Clandestine Service is part of
the CIA, and military units regularly engage in covert operations. It is unlikely, though, that a
government would ever use furtive in the name of its departments or operations, due to the word’s
negative associations. Furtive, in fact, comes from a Latin word for “thief.”

Definition: A level, rank or grade; the people at that level

Usage: Obtaining a job on Wall Street doesn’t guarantee access to the upper echelon of executives,
where multi-million dollar bonuses are the norm. / I’m not sure I’m cut out to analyze poetry; I find it
hard to dig beyond the most accessible echelon of meaning.

Related Words: Stratum (a layer, esp. one of a number of parallel layers, such as in sedimentary rock
or the Earth’s atmosphere; plural is strata, as in “Of all the strata of society, the middle class is the
stratum hit hardest by the recession.”)

More Info: The original meaning of echelon is a formation of troops or war vehicles so as to
resemble steps; similarly, birds flying in such a pattern are flying in echelon.

Definition: Gruesome or excessively vivid; sensational, shocking, unrestrained

Usage: I do like to keep up with what celebrities are doing, but that tabloid is just too lurid for me—
just look at the cover: “Worst Cellulite in Hollywood” and “Exclusive Crash Photos.” Truly horrible.

Related Words: Gratuitous can mean free or voluntary (a gratuity is a tip in a restaurant), but the
other meaning of gratuitous is “without cause or justification; uncalled for.” Gratuitous sex and
violence in the movies is that which doesn’t add to the plot—it’s just there because some people like
to look at things that are lurid.

Definition: Discard, cast off; throw items overboard in order to lighten a ship in an emergency

Usage: We got so tired while hiking the Appalachian Trail that we jettisoned some of our fancy
camping supplies just so we could drag ourselves to a place where we could get medical attention.

Related Words: Cargo jettisoned off a ship is called jetsam. Any bunch of discarded, worthless stuff
can be called flotsam and jetsam.

More Info: Jettison comes from a root for “throw” that also gives us jetty, “a wharf, pier, or other
structure that juts out into the water.”

Definition: A curse

Usage: Sheila thought the fortune-teller was her friend, but when she didn’t pay her bill, the fortune
teller cast a hex on her, a malediction intended to cause terrible things to befall her.

Related Words: Imprecation is a synonym. Execration can mean a curse or cursing, but can also
mean insulting or slandering. All three words can be used in the plural or not, with the same meaning
—for instance, He was such a bitter person it seemed that only execration (or execrations) ever
escaped his lips.

More Info: Mal means “bad,” of course. The root “dict” comes from “dicere” (to say) and also
appears in dictator, dictionary, and indict (connect to a crime), as well as in malediction’s antonym,
benediction (blessing).

Definition: Attractive in a vulgar or flashy way, tawdry; deceptive

Usage: The singer performed her concert draped in what looked from far away like precious jewels.
Up close, though, the fan could see that the accessories were just meretricious plastic, glittery junk,
like what little girls buy at the mall.

Related Words: Showy means showing off and could be good or bad (a showy car). Garish refers to
something much too bright, vivid, or fancy (makeup that looks okay in a nightclub looks garish in the
office). Gaudy items stand out in a cheap, tasteless, or overly colorful way (wearing too much big
jewelry looks gaudy).

More Info: Meretricious comes from a word for “prostitute.” The definition “deceptive” is related to
the idea of something looking better than it really is. Keep in mind that all of these word origins are
based on very old-fashioned ideas, some of them as old as the Romans.

Definition: Lacking consistency or order, disconnected, sporadic; going off topic

Usage: Lulu said she’d been studying for the GRE for a year, but she had been doing so in only the
most desultory way—a few vocab words here and there, then nothing for a month, and practice tests
whenever she felt like it, which was rarely. / Don’t mind my daughter—there’s no need to let a
toddler’s desultory remarks pull an adult conversation off track.

More Info: Desultory comes from the Latin “desultor,” a circus rider who jumps from one horse to
another.

Usage: A notary public will certify a document for a nominal fee, usually under $3. / The country has
a nominal president, but his detractors say he’s just a puppet leader for the more powerful countries

Definition: Offensive, disgusting; harmful

Usage: Everyone knows that smoking is deadly, but even “herbal” cigarettes are a noisome habit—
and noisome to your health!

Related Words: Deleterious means harmful, Baneful means very harmful or fatal, and Noxious means
harmful or morally corrupting. Fetid means smelly.

More Info: Noisome isn’t really about noise! (The word shares a root with “annoy”). The GRE is not
above trying to trick you into picking noisome when you really need a word for “noisy” (like
cacophonous or dissonant).

Definition: Violent whirlpool; any chaotic, turbulent situation

Usage: The Smiths lost their houseboat in a maelstrom, but were at least thankful that they weren’t on
the boat at the time and thus escaped the violent storm at sea. / After having been homeschooled her

Related Words: Tumult (a commotion, uprising, riot, or violent outburst), Din (loud, confused noise),

Usage: Some precursors to the Constitution (such as documents governing the colonies) enumerated
the rights of male property holders only. The U.S. Constitution took a more catholic approach,
declaring that “All men are created equal.” Today, policy writers would probably take catholicism a
step further and write “All people.”

Related Words: Liberal (aside from the use of Liberal in American politics, Liberal means
“favorable to reform; favorable to maximum possible individual freedom; free from prejudice,
tolerant, open-minded”)

More Info: The Catholic Church, of course, goes by that name because it intends (as do many
religions) to be universal.

a bet by also betting on the other side

Usage: While he coaxed and cajoled us all into seeing “the best movie ever,” he hedged once we

where he would actually have to show up and do anything.

that person expanded power to accomplish something.
