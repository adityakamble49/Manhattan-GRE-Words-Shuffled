# Manhattan-GRE-Words-Shuffled

The PDF version is unnecessarily long and sorted alphabetically which makes it hard to study.

So, I decided to write a Python script to read the PDF, shuffle it and store it in a printer friendly format.

+ Added mnemonics from http://www.mnemonicdictionary.com/
+ Word list also available in JSON Format
