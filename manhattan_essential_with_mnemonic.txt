Definition: Condescending, having a superior manner, treating as an inferior

Usage: I’m not surprised that Professor McDougal used to teach kindergarten. His patronizing tone
has been driving me crazy. Not only does he assume we can barely add or subtract, he also makes us
put our heads down and have a moment of silence.

More Info: As a verb, patronize means to be a patron of—that is, to support with money. You can be
a patron of the arts, and restaurants sometimes have signs thanking you for your patronage. This
meaning is positive, while being patronizing is negative. What’s the connection? This word (along
with patriotic) comes from the Latin “pater,” for “father.” Even in Roman times, fathers had a certain
stereotype—they give you money, but they also talk to you like you’re a little kid.

                                              SANK-shun

Definition: Permission or approval, something that gives support or authority to something else (noun); to allow, confirm, ratify (verb);
OR a legal action by one or more countries against another country to get it to comply (noun); to place sanctions or penalties on (verb)

Usage: Professional boxers may only fight in sanctioned matches—fighting outside the ring is prohibited. / America’s sanctions on
Cuba mean that it is illegal for Americans to do business with Cuban companies.

More Info: This word can be very confusing—its two definitions seem to be opposites. Allow and penalize? We have to use context to
figure out the meaning —since the bad meaning (generally “sanctions,” plural) applies to international actions, most usages of sanction
(regarding any other topic) mean “allow.” Sanction comes from the root for holy (also in sanctuary, sanctify, etc.). Imagine an ancient
society in which the ruler is also the spiritual leader, and it’s easy to imagine how legal sanctions could be thought of as “holy.”

Mnemonic:
1. u can read it like sanction ~~ SANG SONG so u sing song when u have been approved or accepted it's
   like being approved to USA..
2. I- SAY-ACTION, slang for I give you permission

Western governments have grown increasingly secular over the last century; many have laws
prohibiting religious expression from being sponsored by the government.

opposition groups were strong enough to seize power.

More Info: Anarchism can sometimes mean the political philosophy that the absence of all direct 
government is ideal and that voluntary associations of individuals would be able to govern 
themselves.

Mnemonic:

performing various actions with the device, but in the end, your “pet” still looks very much like a
keychain.

Related Words: Nominal can mean “in name only” but not in fact. In this way, it is something of an
opposite to virtual, which can mean not in name, but existing in reality (The abused maid was
nominally a free person, but kept as a virtual slave). De facto means “in fact, actually” (but not in

                                         credd-ih-BILL-it-ee

Definition: Believability, trustworthiness

Usage: Many famous “experts” with “Dr.” before their names are not medical doctors at all. Any
television “doctor” who turns out to have a Ph.D. in botany, for instance, ought to suffer a serious
drop in credibility.

More Info: The root “cred,” meaning “believe” also gives us credit, creed, credo, incredulous,
discredit, and accreditation. Don’t confuse credible with credulous, meaning gullible. Finally, while
we often use incredible to mean “great,” it really means “not believable.”

Mnemonic:
1. the root wrd "cred" means "to believe". so credibility means The quality of being believable

are shocked when a lackluster effort in the workplace receives the indifference or mild disapproval
it deserves.

Related Words: Pedestrian and prosaic mean commonplace, dull, or lacking imagination. Quotidian
means daily or commonplace, as daily things tend to be! Middling comes from the idea of being in the

the speaker is the guilty party).

Mnemonic:

More Info: Unlike a mere incongruity, which could be as innocent as one guy with a mohawk at an
otherwise straight-laced gathering, a discrepancy usually indicates that someone has done something
wrong. A discrepancy in your medical records means someone has made a mistake; a discrepancy in
your story means you’re lying.

interesting by writing your own fun sentences, practicing with friends, and thinking about the
gloriousness of a high GRE score.

figurative language can be difficult for English language learners—for instance, to “throw the baby

repair store later, once the heels have worn down.

Related Words: Circumvent (go around, avoid, bypass, such as circumventing the rules)

words do share a root, and the common meaning is that something that is “in the way” is obvious
—and also takes some effort to avoid or obviate.

Mnemonic:
1. obviate - viate sounds like deviate, deviate yourself from studying(happen something)....
2. ob+viate .. viate can be rhymed with void.. and making void means removing something.. hence getting

Usage: When Nixon resigned, American bravado was at an all-time low—the resignation of a sitting
President was disgraceful and unprecedented.

come before.” If something is unprecedented, nothing has come before it. In law, a precedent is a
ruling in a similar case that a judge would draw on or reference in writing a decision.

                                        Also unscathed (adj)

Definition: Severe, injurious; bitterly harsh or critical (as a remark)

Usage: The school superintendant gave a scathing criticism of the education bill, calling it “an attack
on our community’s children that will surely go down in infamy.” / How is it possible that she flew
off her bicycle like that and walked away unscathed?

More Info: As you can see from the use of unscathed to mean “not physically injured,” scathing
originally referred to physical injury and now generally refers to injurious comments. A word used in
a similar metaphorical way is excoriate, which literally means “to rub the skin off of” but is more
often used to mean “to criticize very harshly.”

Mnemonic:
1. sounds like SKATING...when I said I will do skating on highway, my mother started scathing
2. it's a SCARY + THING
3. Skating: My mom gave an scathing remark when i said i would go skating with my frens, she said
   skating would be scathing in rainy season!

More Info: Partisan is related to the idea of a party (as in a political party). A party or other self-
interested group can also be called a faction. Partisanship gone too far could be called factionalism.

Definition: Characteristic of an earlier period, ancient, primitive

Usage: The school’s archaic computer system predated even floppy disks—it stored records on tape

“archaic”—unless you are a Shakespeare scholar, you can safely ignore those archaisms.

Related Words: Obsolete (out of date, no longer used), Antediluvian (extremely old, before the 
Biblical flood)

More Info: “Archaic” is especially used to describe language common to an older time but rare 
today, such as “thou” or “forsooth.” If a word appears in a dictionary with “archaic” next to a 
secondary meaning, that meaning is unlikely to be tested on the GRE.

Mnemonic:

2. The word resembles like archies ...the old archies card are kept with us.
3. Remember with Archive. As we keep very old thing in archive- Archaic is related something very old.

send back an entree when he complained that black truffle oil had been substituted for white. The chef

More Info: Many people automatically think of discriminating as bad, because they are thinking of
racial discrimination. However, discriminating is simply telling things apart and can be an important
skill—it is important to discriminate legitimate colleges from fraudulent diploma mills, for instance.

it.

known.

                                        Also Apocrypha (noun)

Definition: Of questionable authenticity; false

Usage: I’m sorry, but this putative letter from George Washington that you found at a garage sale is 
clearly apocryphal—it is riddled with anachronisms (for instance, Washington was long dead by the 
time silent films were invented), and also, Washington most certainly didn’t refer to Martha 
Washington as “hey baby.”

Related Words: Ersatz (artificial, synthetic, serving as a substitute), Faux (fake, imitation, as in “faux 
fur”), Specious (pleasing to the eye but deceptive)

More Info: The word “Apocrypha” often refers to books that have been rejected for inclusion in 
(various versions of) the Bible, either due to dubious authenticity or because the Church considered 
them useful, but not divinely inspired. Obviously, different authorities disagree about what exactly is 
included in the Apocrypha.

Mnemonic:
1. Apocryphal Hypocritical (of false appearance of virtue)
2. Derived from root "crypt" which means "secret". So, Apocryphal means "of doubtful authenticity"
3. Assume a girl's cry. Cry is a part of the word Apo'cry'phal. Girl's crying is false and made up. So,
   Apocryphal means made up or questionable.
4. apo+cry+phal:ur crying so mom question's u..questionable...u say fall which is untrue
5. apocryphal = apo + cry + phal; so you cry realizing that your new jewellery is spurious!
6. APO CRY FAIL- you cry because,you fail; but that is untrue because i am sure you passed; therefore
   its of questionable authority...

Definition: Practical; dealing with actual facts and reality

Usage: Megan and Dave were in love, but Megan decided to be pragmatic—she doubted they’d stay
together through a four-year long distance relationship as they attended different colleges, so she
figured they might as well end things now.

Related Words: Politic (shrewd, pragmatic; tactful or diplomatic), Expedient (suitable, proper;
effective, often at the expense of ethics or other considerations)

More Info: A pragmatic sanction is a ruler’s declaration having the force of law. A ruler might issue
a pragmatic sanction when the ideal situation isn’t possible, so one must be practical and “just get
the job done.”

Mnemonic:
1. PRA + gma + TIC = PRA + c + TIC + al

verbiage (excess words or style of expressing something in words). A verbose person could stand to
cut down on the verbiage.

Definition: Indicate or suggest beforehand, presage

Usage: You didn’t know this was a horror movie? I thought it was pretty clear that the children’s ghost
story around the campfire was meant to foreshadow the horrible things that would happen to them
years later as teenagers at a motel in the middle of the woods.

Related Words: Prefigure is a synonym. Forerun means run before or foreshadow. Harbinger and
Herald mean a person or thing that indicates what is to come (Herald can also mean “messenger,”
including about something in the past). Portentous and Ominous can mean “giving a bad sign about

Definition: A harsh satire (noun); ridicule or satirize (verb)

Usage: “As a Democrat,” said Bob, “I can’t say I appreciated watching that comedian in the Obama
mask lampoon the State of the Union address.”

Related Words: To satirize is to use ridicule, sarcasm, etc. as a form of criticism. Parody is similar
but often not as harsh—the key difference is that a parody is actually a copy (the Scary Movie series
parodies the horror genre).

More Info: Lampoon comes from a French word for to lap up—as in, to guzzle beer, which is what
you’d probably be doing while watching a lampoon.

Mnemonic:
1. LAMPOON- if you pour oil for a LAMP with a SPOON ppl will ridicule cos for a lamp you should pour a
   lot of oil!!!

Definition: Conjecture about an unknown by projecting information about something known; predict
by projecting past experience

Usage: No, I’ve never been to Bryn Mawr, but I’ve visited several small, private women’s colleges
in the Northeast, so I think I can extrapolate.

More Info: In math and science, to extrapolate is to infer values in an unobserved interval from
values in an observed interval. For instance, from the points (1, 4) and (3, 8), you could extrapolate
the point (5, 12), since it would be on the same line. The antonym of extrapolate is interpolate, to
estimate between two known values, such as by using (1, 4) and (3, 8) to assume (2, 6). Interpolate
can also mean “insert words or foreign material into a text or conversation.”

Mnemonic:
1. from the EXTRA info that u have, u guess what might happen LATEly or in future

chronic (ongoing, usually of an illness), and anachronism (thing out of its own time period).

was entitled Duke of Richmond in 1675.” An entitlement can also mean a government benefit, as in
“Social Security payments and other entitlements.”

Usage: Everyone had a hard time correctly saying the name of the seminar, “Perspectives for
Prospective Doctors.” Even the prospective doctors—college students hoping to be admitted to
medical school—were a bit confused.

More Info: Don’t confuse with perspective (point of view). Perspective is a noun, which is a good
clue that you want prospective in phrases like “prospective student” (usually a person applying to a
college but not yet accepted).

Usage: Plagiarism is proscribed by every college’s code of conduct.

Related Words: Censure (strong disapproval or official reprimand), Circumscribe (encircle or
confine, set limits)

More Info: The “scribe” in proscribe means “write” (as in script, scribble, scripture, etc.) The sense
is that to proscribe is to publish a record of someone’s punishment—to condemn or sentence that
person publicly. Don’t confuse proscribe with prescribe, which means “order, set down as a rule”
(like a doctor’s prescription)—the two words are opposites!

Mnemonic:
1. When you want a magazine, you PREscribe(subscribe) it. Similarly when you want to stop it, you will

Usage: Our romantic vacation was abridged when the babysitter called to say that the kids were sick 
and we should come home. / Audio books are almost always abridged, since few people want to 
listen to a 200-hour book.

Related Words: Truncate (shorten by cutting off a part)
Memory Trick: When you abridge a book, you cut out sections from all over (hopefully without being 
too obvious)—that is, you create a bridge from the last part you kept in to the next part you kept in, so 
people don’t notice the missing bits. An abridged book still tells the whole story; a truncated book is 
missing the ending!

Mnemonic:
1. a+bridge..well bridges are meant to reduce the gap between something..so abridging..something means
   reducingor shortening something.

3. CRESCENDO - CR + ESCENDO (ASCEND) - ascend means a gradual rising...here it refers to an increase in
   volume.
4. do u know the organisation red crescent? the shape of curved moon in red crescent's symbol? so this
   moon's shape will be full in days step by step. And crescendo means gradual increase in the
   intensity
5. The crescent moon fills in more and more reaching a crescendo of being full.
6. another mnemonic:the climax or end of the krish movie is very good.

or “lightness” (as in lever, elevate), so you can think of raising money through taxes, raising an army
by drafting soldiers, or using that army to wage war.

Mnemonic:
1. Traffic Police catches you breaking signal and says LE(le)+VY(Bhai) chalaan. chal tax de. So he
   LEVIED the tax on you

Usage: The boss was famously laconic; after allowing his employees to present their new plan for an
entire hour, he finally responded, “Confirmed.”

Related Words: Reticent and Taciturn (not talking much) are often used to describe shy people and
do not have the sense of “getting the point across efficiently” that laconic does. Pithy, however, takes
this idea even further—it means getting the point across in just a few, cleverly-chosen words.

More Info: Laconic comes from the Greek place named Laconia, the region in which Sparta (which
of course gives us spartan) was located. A famous story has an invading general threatening, “If I
enter Laconia, I will raze Sparta to the ground.” The Spartans laconically replied, “If.”

mere name-calling, not suitable for public discourse. / Your criticism of Anne is unwarranted—as
your assistant, she has done everything you’ve asked her to do. / He doesn’t have his documents with

$2,000. / All those weeks of working weekends and playing golf with the boss ought to net her a
promotion.

Related Words: The opposite of net is gross. Your gross income is what your company pays you, and
your net income is what you actually get to take home. If you sell merchandise, all the money you
collect is the gross, but very little of that (or even none of it) may be profit—you have to subtract
expenses to calculate the net.

More Info: A related idea is tare. If you go to a pay-by-the-pound salad bar and get your salad in a
heavy dish, the person weighing the salad will often deduct the tare—the weight of the dish—prior to
calculating what you pay.

associating the company’s image with fine service. / There’s nothing in the denotation of “crotchety”

government to administer, while some conservatives say that liberalism means having the smallest
government possible in order to maximize freedom. For the GRE, liberal means generous, freely-
flowing, open-minded, or pertaining to values like freedom of speech.
